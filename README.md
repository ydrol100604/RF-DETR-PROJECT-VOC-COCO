# RF-DETR-PROJECT-VOC-COCO
This project implements an end-to-end object detection system using the RF-DETR (Receptive Field Enhanced Detection Transformer) model on a custom image dataset. Built with PyTorch, the pipeline includes data preparation, model architecture, training, evaluation, and visualization.

Project Goals
Acquire and prepare a COCO-style object detection dataset
Implement the RF-DETR architecture:
    CNN backbone (ResNet)
    Transformer encoder-decoder
    Receptive Field Enhancement module
    Prediction heads and Hungarian matcher
    Train and optimize the model using deep learning best practices
    Evaluate performance using precision, recall, accuracy, and mAP
    Visualize predictions and conduct error analysis

To run with your own dataset, feel free to cater the dataset block with your own dataset using local, roboflow, or kaggle.
