# RF-DETR-PROJECT-VOC-COCO
This project implements an end-to-end object detection system using the RF-DETR (Receptive Field Enhanced Detection Transformer) model on a custom image dataset. Built with PyTorch, the pipeline includes data preparation, model architecture, training, evaluation, and visualization.

<h1> Project Goals </h1>
*Acquire and prepare a COCO-style object detection dataset<br>
*Implement the RF-DETR architecture
    *CNN backbone (ResNet)<br>
    *Transformer encoder-decoder<br>
    *Receptive Field Enhancement module<br>
    *Prediction heads and Hungarian matcher<br>
    *Train and optimize the model using deep learning best practices<br>
    *Evaluate performance using precision, recall, accuracy, and mAP<br>
    *Visualize predictions and conduct error analysis<br>
<h1> Specifics </h1>
The dataset we used for this project is the VOC 2012 dataset that has been converted to COCO. 
<h1>Try with your own dataset!</h1>
<h3> Setup </h3>
The environment is easy to setup just run all and train away. Everything will be provided in the .ipynb file.
<h3> Dataset </h3>
To run with your own dataset, feel free to cater the dataset block with your own dataset using local, roboflow, or kaggle. <br>
